# bip39brute
Tool for brute forcing BIP39 seed phrases

Code exists as a demo trying to crack the wallet shown in the reddit thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/i63122/a_metal_plate_with_random_words_engraved_found/

Some useful resources:

Could use some threading if intended for serious use :-)

Tweet @deanpierce on twitter if you find this helpful or to demand improvements. To my knowledge it hasn't actually cracked anything useful yet, but maybe some day!
